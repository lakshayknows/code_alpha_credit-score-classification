Credit Scoring Model

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Credit Scoring Model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data. The model employs Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to classify individuals as creditworthy or non-creditworthy.

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of financial attributes such as income, loan amount, repayment history, credit utilization, and debt-to-income ratio.

Missing values were handled using imputation techniques.

Feature scaling was applied to ensure model consistency.

🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🚀 Approach

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values using mean/median imputation.

Applied feature scaling (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler).

Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE or class weighting.

Model Selection & Training

Implemented classification models:

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV.

Model Evaluation

Achieved 80% accuracy.

Compared models and selected the best-performing one.

📊 Results

Final Model: GradientBoosting

Accuracy: 80%

Key Insights: Feature importance analysis highlighted that repayment history and debt-to-income ratio were the most significant factors affecting creditworthiness.

🔥 Future Enhancements

Implement deep learning techniques to improve accuracy.
Fine-tune hyperparameters further for better generalization.
Incorporate additional financial indicators for richer insights.
