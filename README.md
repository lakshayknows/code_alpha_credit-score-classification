# 🚀 Credit Scoring Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Credit Scoring Model** to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data. The model employs **Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** to classify individuals as creditworthy or non-creditworthy.

## 📂 Dataset
📊 The dataset includes financial attributes such as:
- **Income** 💰
- **Loan Amount** 💳
- **Repayment History** 📅
- **Credit Utilization** 📈
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio** ⚖️

✔️ Missing values were handled using **imputation techniques**.
✔️ Feature scaling was applied to maintain model consistency.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
🔹 **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
🔹 **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Approach
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
✅ Handled missing values using **mean/median imputation**.
✅ Applied **feature scaling** (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler).
✅ Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE or class weighting**.

### 2️⃣ Model Selection & Training
🧠 Implemented classification models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest** 🌲
- **Gradient Boosting** 🚀
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** 🕸️

⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV**.

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation
📌 Achieved **80% accuracy**.
📌 Compared models and selected the best-performing one.

## 📊 Results
🏆 **Final Model:** Gradient Boosting
✅ **Accuracy:** 80%
📢 **Key Insights:** Feature importance analysis highlighted that **repayment history and debt-to-income ratio** were the most significant factors affecting creditworthiness.

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
🔍 Implement **deep learning techniques** to improve accuracy.
🔍 Fine-tune hyperparameters further for better generalization.
🔍 Incorporate additional financial indicators for richer insights.
