# Credit Score Classification using ML and ANN

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying credit scores using machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The dataset undergoes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering before applying classification models.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains financial and demographic attributes used to determine a person's credit score.
- Missing values are handled through imputation techniques.
- Outliers are capped to improve model performance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Correcting data types
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing/capping outliers
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing distributions and correlations
   - Understanding feature importance

3. **Model Implementation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
   - Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/credit-score-classification.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data and train models.

## Results
- Model performance is evaluated based on classification metrics.
- ANN model results are compared with traditional ML models to assess improvements.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of ML and ANN in classifying credit scores. Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters and incorporating additional features.
